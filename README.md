Great job on completing the project! Here's a sample **README** for your Cub3D project on GitHub. You can customize it as needed based on your specific implementation or any additional features you may have added.

# Cub3D

Cub3D is a simple 3D game engine created using **C** and **raycasting**. The project is a part of the curriculum at **42 Network** (or similar programming courses), designed to help students learn about graphics, game engines, and the basics of 3D rendering.

Inspired by classic 3D games like **Wolfenstein 3D**, Cub3D simulates a 3D environment using 2D raycasting techniques. The project allows players to explore a maze-like world by rendering walls, floors, and textures based on their position and orientation.

---

## Features

- **Raycasting Engine**: Renders a 3D environment from a 2D grid, creating the illusion of depth and perspective.
- **Player Movement**: Allows the player to move forward, backward, and rotate within the environment.
- **Texturing**: Walls and floors are textured based on ray intersections, creating a more realistic scene.
- **Map Editor**: A simple text-based map format that can be used to design different 2D mazes or levels.
- **Basic Controls**: WASD for movement, arrow keys for rotation, and mouse to adjust the viewpoint.
- **Minimalistic 3D Rendering**: Emulates early 3D FPS games by drawing walls and floors based on raycasting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Cub3D project, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- **C Compiler**: GCC or Clang
- **Make**: For building the project
- **MinilibX**: A small X library for graphical rendering (usually provided with the 42 course, or can be installed separately)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cub3d.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd cub3d
   ```

3. Compile the project using `make`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./cub3d maps/map1.cub
   ```

   Replace `maps/map1.cub` with the path to any valid map file you want to load.

---

## Controls

- **W, A, S, D**: Move forward, left, backward, and right respectively.
- **Arrow Keys**: Rotate the camera view left or right.
- **Mouse**: Adjust the camera's horizontal view (if enabled).
- **Esc**: Exit the game.

---

## File Structure

The project contains the following key files:

- `src/` – The source code for the raycasting engine and game logic.
- `maps/` – Folder containing `.cub` map files, which define the game levels.
- `textures/` – Folder containing texture images for walls, floors, and ceilings.
- `Makefile` – For compiling the project.
- `README.md` – This documentation!

## How It Works

Cub3D uses **raycasting** to render a 3D environment by casting rays from the player's position and determining the closest intersection with walls. Each ray's intersection is then mapped to a column on the screen, creating a visual representation of the 3D world.

The program reads a 2D map file (typically with `.cub` extension), where walls and floors are represented by different characters. The engine computes the perspective view by simulating how rays would interact with the map layout, then renders textures on the walls and floors accordingly.

### Raycasting Process

1. **Casting Rays**: For each vertical column of the screen, a ray is cast from the player's position. The ray moves through the grid and checks for intersections with walls.
2. **Calculating Depth**: The depth of each wall is calculated based on the distance of the ray to the wall it hits.
3. **Rendering**: The depth information is used to scale and draw textures onto the walls to simulate a 3D perspective.
4. **Floor and Ceiling**: The floor and ceiling are rendered as static textures based on the player's viewpoint.

## Example Map

A simple example of a `.cub` map file looks like this:

```
1111111111111111
1000000000000001
1010101010101001
1000000000000001
1111111111111111
```

Where `1` represents a wall, and `0` represents an empty space (floor). The program will render this as a maze that you can explore in the game.
